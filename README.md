## Future development

* Fix current bugs in search, delete and update functionality.

* Enable users to select projects that they can then export as a Word Document using technology such as DOCX.JS.

* Integration with existing project management software systems so that project details are preloaded, and users only have to add in relevant project descriptions and case studies related to a project.

* While this is a web-based application, improve responsiveness and provide better user experience for users across devices.
